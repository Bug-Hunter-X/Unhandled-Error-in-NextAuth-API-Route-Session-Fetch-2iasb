# NextAuth API Route - Unhandled Session Fetch Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js API routes that use `next-auth` for authentication. The problem arises from the lack of proper error handling when fetching the user session.  A failure during session retrieval silently results in a 500 Internal Server Error rather than a more informative 401 Unauthorized.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that gracefully handles the potential error during session fetching, returning a 401 status code if authentication fails.

## How to reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Access the API route (the exact endpoint would depend on your `next-auth` setup).
5. Observe the error response (500 in the buggy version, 401 in the fixed version).

## Solution:

The solution involves wrapping the `unstable_getServerSession` call in a `try...catch` block to catch potential errors and return an appropriate response.
